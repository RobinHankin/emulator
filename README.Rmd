# Overview

To cite the `emulator` package in publications please use Hankin 2005.
The `emulator` package provides R-centric functionality for working
with Gaussian processes.  The focus is on approximate evaluation of
complex computer codes.  The package is part of the the `BACCO` suite
of software.


# Installation

You can install the released version of permutations from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("emulator")  # uncomment this to use the package
library("emulator")
```

The package is maintained on
[github](https://github.com/RobinHankin/emulator).	

# The `emulator` package in use


```{r echo = FALSE}
set.seed(0)
options(digits=3)
fish <- c(1,1,4)  # roughness scales
var <- 0.3      # variance
real.relation <- function(x){sum( (1:3)*x )} # real relation
val  <- latin.hypercube(7,3)
colnames(val) <- c("alpha","beta","gamma")
A <- corr.matrix(val,scales=fish)
d <-  as.vector(rmvnorm(n=1,mean=apply(val,1,real.relation),var*A))
```

Suppose we have a complicated computer program which takes three
parameters as input, and we can run it a total of seven times at
different points in parameter space:

```{r}
val
d
```

Above, `val` shows the seven points in parameter space at which we
have run the code, and `d` shows the output at those points.  Now
suppose we wish to know what the code would have produced at point
$p=(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)$, at which the point has not actually been run.
This is straightforward with the package:


```{r}
p <- c(0.5,0.5,0.)
fish <- c(1,1,4)
A <- corr.matrix(val,scales=fish)
interpolant(p, d, val, A = A, scales=fish, give=TRUE)
```

Above, object `fish` is a vector of roughness length ("scales")
corresponding to the small-scale covariance properties of our
function.  This may be estimated from the problem or from the
datapoints.  Matrix `A` is a normalized variance-covariance matrix for
the points of `val`.

The output gives various aspects of the Gaussian process associated
with the original observations.  The most interesting one is
`mstar.star` which indicates that the best estimate for the code's
output, if it were to be run at point $p$, would be about 2.41.
