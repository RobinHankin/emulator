Description:  
 Allows one to estimate the output of a computer program,
 as a function of the input parameters, without actually running it.
 The computer program is assumed to be a Gaussian process, whose
 parameters are estimated using Bayesian techniques that give a PDF of
 expected program output.  This PDF is conditional on a ``training set''
 of runs, each consisting of a point in parameter space and the model
 output at that point.  The emphasis is on complex codes that take
 weeks or months to run, and that have a large number of undetermined
 input parameters; many climate prediction models fall into this
 class.  The emulator essentially determines Bayesian posterior
 estimates of the PDF of the output of a model, conditioned on results
 from previous runs and a user-specified prior linear model.  A vignette is
 provided and the help pages include examples.
